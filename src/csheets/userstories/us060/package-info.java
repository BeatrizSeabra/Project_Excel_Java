/**
 * Technical documentation regarding the user story 060: US060 - Extend menus with macros.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * 
 * <b>Requisitos</b><br/>
 * This use case consist in show to the user of the application, a window that allows<br/>
 * he to assign an execution of a macro to a menu option indicates whether you want<br/>
 * the macro to run before (Before Menu Action), after (After Menu Action) or<br/> 
 * instead (Around Menu Action) of the menu item in question.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 *  
 * <b>S060a: Analysis</b><br/>
 * The user storie US060 continues the work of users stories US059 and US058, for<br/> 
 * that was first necessary to make an analysis of what had already been done in the<br/> 
 * previous two iterations, in order to understand the follow-up to this user storie<br/>
 * and see if any functionality needed to be complete before processer with the new<br/>
 * user storie US060. After a review concluded that both were operating, was only<br/> 
 * dependent on the realization of user storie US044 - "Janela de edição de Macros.",<br/>
 * since this is what allows you to edit and create a macro, and next associate<br/> 
 * with a menu option of the cleansheets, for when execute the option chosen this<br/> 
 * can be performed in the cleansheets. To make the association between the<br/>
 * implementation of macro and an option from the menu cleansheets, you need to<br/> 
 * analyze the whole process of the actions of the menu item as well as get a<br/> 
 * macro and therefore can run it.
