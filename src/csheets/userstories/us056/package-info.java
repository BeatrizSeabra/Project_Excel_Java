/**
 * Technical documentation regarding the user story 056: Cell's Events with formulas. 
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * 
 * <b>Requirement</b><br/>
 * Join the events of cell formulas that must be performed. 
 * Must be at least one new function (in formulas) that allows you to write text in the log file.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 *  
 * <b>S056a: Analysis</b><br/>
 * Since there are two types of events that are already defined, the user can atribute a formula that event.
 * So if the cell event has a formula assigned to it, everytime that event occurs, the formula is executed.
 * For everytime that a formula is executed, it will write on log file when the event occurs.
 * <br/>
