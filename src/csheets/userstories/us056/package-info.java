/**
 * Technical documentation regarding the user story 056: Cell's Events with formulas. 
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * 
 * <b>Requirement</b><br/>
 * Join the events of cell formulas that must be performed. 
 * Must be at least one new function (in formulas) that allows you to write text in the log file.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 *  
 * <b>S056a: Analysis</b><br/>
 * Since there are two types of events that are already defined, we need now to add this type that consists when we write a formula on the cell.
 * I will take the interface that already exists to ask about previous events and will add the new event named Formulas.
 * When is writen some formula on some cell, it will write on EventLogFile that register at what hour it occurred and what formula was introduced.
