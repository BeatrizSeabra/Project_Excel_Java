/**
 * Technical documentation regarding the user story 075: Exportation Link. 
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * 
* <b>Requirement</b><br/>
* Instead of exporting, it should be possible to link to a file text. 
* The process is similar but from the moment the link is established, whenever the cell change, the text file must be updated.
* <br/>
* <br/>
*  
* <b>S007a: Analysis</b><br/>
* It will be possible to, whenever that the cell changed, and if the file is already created (that means that the link needs to be established), the content is updated in the text file.
* For that there will be a thread and maybe an infinite cicle that makes the thread and exportation never ends.
* That way if a cell is changed, there will be an exportation of that modification.
* <br/>
