/**
 * Technical documentation regarding the user story 007: sort cells. 
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * 
 * <b>Requirement</b><br/>
 * Sort by order the cells content. For this use case only need to sort one collumn.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 *  
 * <b>S001a: Analysis</b><br/>
 * 
 * Since the cells will be filled with strings and number, they will need to be sort by order. The user will be able to choose how he/she want to order the collumn.
 * This will be added to the submenu Sort on Edit menu that will open a JFrame or a messageDialog to input the collumn to be order.
 * The class method that will be called is SortAction() that creates a new sorting action and then will use the actionPerformed method that will allow the user to choose the criteria wanted. 
 * Then will be called a new method that contains the code for sorting all the collumn with the order type picked by the user.
